This repository provides a **working example** to learn and test [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) automation - the test scripting language used by [Robotmk](https://www.robotmk.org) for *Synthetic Monitoring* in [Checkmk](https://checkmk.com).

## How to Run the example

### Run online in a VS Code Devcontainer (recommended)

This is the easiest way to run the example — no local installation needed. Just click the button below:

[![Run this Robot in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/robotmk/example-web-webshop)

→ [How to run the example in Codespace](https://github.com/elabit/robotmk-starter/blob/main/docs/example-guide.md)

> **What is a GitHub Codespace?**  
> A Codespace is a browser-based development environment (VS Code) hosted by GitHub — no local installation needed.  

### Manually with RCC

To run Robot Framework suites manually, refer to the Robotmk blog post with the step-by-step instructions for RCC:
   
→ [How to Run Robot Framework Examples with RCC](https://www.robotmk.org/en/blog/rcc-efficient-python-integration/)  
→ [Troubleshooting RCC](https://www.robotmk.org/en/blog/rcctrouble/)


## About this Robot Framework test

Full checkout-flow example using [robotframework-browser](https://robotframework-browser.org) and
[robotframework-crypto](https://github.com/Snooz82/robotframework-crypto), driven by the
Robotmk **multi-profile** feature.
The same suite runs once per user profile with profile-specific encrypted credentials.


- Robotmk **multi-profile** execution: one `robot.toml` defines three user profiles (`JaneDoe`, `JackHowe`, `BobSmith`)
- Per-profile `extend-variables` override `USER_EMAIL`, `USER_PASSWORD`, and `USER_NAME`
- Encrypted passwords via CryptoLibrary — `crypt:…` values stored directly in `robot.toml`
- A real checkout flow modularised across multiple keyword resource files (`Resources/`)
- Dynamic `output-dir` with a timestamp expression in `robot.toml`

## Test Cases

| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| `User Can Reach Checkout Page` | Logs in as the configured user, adds items to the cart, and completes checkout |

The suite is executed **three times** — once per profile (JaneDoe, JackHowe, BobSmith) — each
with its own credentials and a timestamped output directory.
